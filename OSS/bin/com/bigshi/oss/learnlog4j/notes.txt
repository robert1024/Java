- 3 main components:
	* loggers: Responsible for capturing logging information.
	* appenders : Responsible for publishing logging information to various preferred destinations.
	* layouts: Responsible to format logging information in different styles.

- Core Objects: These are mandatory objects of the framework and required to use the framework.
	* Logger Object
	* Layout Object
	* Appender Object

- Support Objects: These are optional objects of the framework and support core objects to perform addition but important tasks.
	* Level Object
		~  OFF, DEBUG, INFO, ERROR, WARN, FATAL, and ALL.
	* Filter Object
	* ObjectRenderer
	* LogManager

- Debug Level
	* TRACE
		~ Designates finer-grained informational events than the DEBUG.
	* DEBUG
		~ Designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application.
	* INFO
		~ Designates informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level.
	* WARN
		~ Designates potentially harmful situations.
	* ERROR
		~ Designates error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
	* FATAL
		~ Designates very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.
	* ALL
		~ All levels including custom levels.
	*  ALL < DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR < FATAL < OFF	

- Properties of Apperder Object
	* layout 
	* target
	* level
	* threshold
	* filter

- Add an Appender object to a Logger
	* log4j.logger.[logger-name]=level, appender1,appender..n
	* In program: public void addAppender(Appender appender);

- Appender to file
	* FileAppender
	* RollingFileAppender
	* DailyRollingFileAppender
	
- DatePattern(when to roll over the file)
	* '.' yyyy-MM			Roll over at the end of each month and the beginning of the next month.
	* '.' yyyy-MM-dd		This is the default value and roll over at midnight each day.
